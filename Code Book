# Code Book for Course Project submission for Getting and Cleaning Data

##Description of the raw data

A full description of raw data can be found on this website: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Transformations on the raw data follow the sequence and processing as defined in the project requirements and are explained below:
The data

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt': Readme which shows how to work with the dataset.

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training dataset.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test dataset.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data.

'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

###Step 1: Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

The data in the file activity_labels.txt is read into the array activityType. This array is of dimension 2X6 and contains the names of the 6 descriptive activities, as shown below:
V1	V2
1	WALKING
2	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4	SITTING
5	STANDING
6	LAYING

The data for Training and Test measurements (which in their raw form reside in different files) are read into different variables.

The Train and Test sets are processed to align the column names.
For both Train and Test sets, the function cbind us used to bring together the data in these three files for Train: y_Train.txt, subject_Train.txt, and x_Train.txt and for Test: y_Test.txt, subject_Test.txt, and x_Test.txt.

The Training set contains 7352 records
The Test set contains 2947 records

The two sets are merged using the R function - rbind.

##The Characteristics: of the data set are
Multivariate, Time-Series
Number of Instances: 10299 [That's 7352 records in the Training set plus 2947 records in the test set]
The Number of Attributes: 561

##Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


###Step 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The grepl function is used to identify and extract columns that pertain to ID, mean() & stddev() columns.


###Step 3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Names to columns are allocated to provide descriptive activity names using the names given in activity_labels.txt


###Step 4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. Assumption: Descriptive names = descriptive column names. Column names also set in Part 2
The variable names are cleaned up using the gsub function

###Step 5: Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

A table is created to include just the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject
